## Objective
_(1-2 paragraphs) What are you doing, why, and for whom?_

_What problems are you trying to solve? Consider goals and NON-goals. Make the objective understandable for someone unfamiliar with this project. The details come later in the Background and Requirements sections._

## Background
_(1-2 paragraphs) What background context is necessary?_

_Mention any related work that has been done, if any. Also, justify the need for this with a compelling user story; user-centered design is an important part of the design process. Link other supplementary documents or glossary entries as necessary. There is no need to write about the design, specific requirements details, or ideas to solve problems here._

## Requirements and Scale
_(2-5 paragraphs) What needs to be done?_

_What problem are you trying to solve? Who are the users? Your job here is to quickly educate others about the details you know about the problem space, so they can help review your implementation._

_The better and more succinct your summary is, the better others can (a) understand the problem and your design, (b) help you consider alternate designs, (c) help you refine your ideas._

## Design Ideas
_(2-5 paragraphs) Proposed Solutions._

_A short and sweet overview of your implementation ideas. If you have multiple solutions to a problem you would like feedback on, list them concisely in a short bullet list._

_This should contain most details of your implementation like digrams and [mocks](/docs/glossary/mock.md), but you should avoid including too much code. What will the components look like? What technologies will be used to write them? How can this feature be expanded in the future. Are there any information security concerns to address?_

## Timeline
_Break down the feature into individual tasks. Provide a time estimate for each one, and assign tasks if necessary_

_Most of the feedback in this section will be on how the work has been broken up_

_Once the design document is approved, these should be turned into [issues](/docs/glossary/issues.md) that show up on the [Project Board](/docs/glossary/project_board)_

## Alternatives Considered
_(2 paragraphs) Include alternate design ideas here which you are leaning away from and short justifications as to why_
