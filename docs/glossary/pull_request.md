# Pull Request (PR)
This oddly named term refers to submitting a [branch](/docs/glossary/branch.md)'s changes for review to be [merged](/docs/glossary/merge) or "pulled" into another branch. Pull requests are where most of the discussions surrounding feedback will be had.

**TODO: Explain how to make a PR and the best way to comment on one**
